"[2] Total ethnic origin responses are the sum of single and multiple responses for each ethnic origin. Total response counts indicate the number of persons who reported a specified ethnic origin, either as their only origin or in addition to one or more other ethnic origins. The sum of all ethnic origin responses is greater than the total population estimate due to the reporting of multiple origins."
"[3] A single ethnic origin response occurs when a person provides one ethnic origin only."
"[4] A multiple ethnic origin response occurs when a person provides two or more ethnic origins."
"[5] This is a total population estimate. The sum of the ethnic groups in this table is greater than the total population estimate because a person may report more than one ethnic origin in the census."
