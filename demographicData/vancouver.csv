Notes:
1,"""Gender"" refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman)."
,"Gender includes the following concepts:"
,"* gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;"
,"* gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender."
,"A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time."
,"Some people may not identify with a specific gender."
,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category ""non-binary persons"" are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the ""+"" symbol."
2,"This category includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons."
3,"This category includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons."
102,"""Visible minority"" refers to whether a person is a visible minority or not, as defined by the Employment Equity Act. The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese."
,"In 2021 Census analytical and communications products, the term ""visible minority"" has been replaced by the terms ""racialized population"" or ""racialized groups,"" reflecting the increased use of these terms in the public sphere."
,"For more information on visible minority and population group variables, including information on their classifications, the questions from which they are derived, data quality and their comparability with other sources of data, please refer to the Visible Minority and Population Group Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021."
103,"In 2021 Census analytical and communications products, the term ""visible minority"" has been replaced by the terms ""racialized population"" or ""racialized groups,"" reflecting the increased use of these terms in the public sphere."
104,"The abbreviation ""n.i.e."" means ""not included elsewhere."" This category includes persons who provided responses that are classified as a visible minority, but that cannot be classified with a specific visible minority group. Such responses include, for example, ""Guyanese,"" ""Pacific Islander,"" ""Polynesian,"" ""Tibetan"" and ""West Indian."""
105,"In 2021 Census analytical and communications products, this category is referred to as ""the rest of the population."""
106,"""Ethnic or cultural origin"" refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of the person's ancestors. Ancestors may have Indigenous origins, origins that refer to different countries or other origins that may not refer to different countries."
,"The sum of the ethnic or cultural origins in this table is greater than the total population estimate because a person may report more than one ethnic or cultural origin in the census."
,"The ethnic or cultural origins selected are the most frequently reported at the Canada level."
,"For more information on ethnic or cultural origin variables, including information on their classifications, the questions from which they are derived, data quality and their comparability with other sources of data, please refer to the Ethnic or Cultural Origin Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021."
